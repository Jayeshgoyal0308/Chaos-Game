# Chaos-Game
This is a simulation of "Chaos Game" using JavaScript and HTML Canvas.

I found out about this beautiful phenomenon through a youtube video [here](https://youtu.be/kbKtFN71Lfs) and was straight away amazed with it , so i tried to implement it.

Thanks to JavaScript for giving me the power to program my curiosity and explore the beauty of chaos in math.
